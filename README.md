## About The Project

HerbaID is an innovative mobile application aimed at providing users with personalized herbal remedies for common health issues. With the increasing interest in natural remedies, our team saw the opportunity to create a solution that empowers users to address their health concerns using herbal options. The app will allow users to input their specific symptoms or health issues and either scan the ingredients they have at home or choose from a list of available ingredients in the app. Based on this information, the app will generate herbal remedy recommendations, which users can save as favorites for future reference. The project aims to promote holistic health and wellness by making herbal remedies more accessible and user-friendly.
